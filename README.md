## Project
Part of the Codecademy 'Full Stack Engineer' Course. The prompt has been provided below.

## Prompt
In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance. 

## Improvements
I left the design spec in order to move away from fixed pixel values. My site should be viewable on all devices. I used flexbox to achieve this responsiveness.
